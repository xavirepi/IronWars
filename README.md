## About
<p>IronWars is an arcade web-based video game inspired in the famous 90's arcade game Buster Bros (Super Pang! in Spain).</p>
<p>The main goal was to create a logic following the same as the Buster Bros and run it on  any web browser. The ultimate goal was to create a new design based on Star Wars as well as to be able to play it using a gamepad.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to blow up all the balls and clear the game ground from floating balls in the least amount of time. The quicker the balls are cleared, the higher the score. If the counter gets to 0 and there are still balls floating around, the game is over and the player cannot continue to the next level.</p>

## How to play?
At the moment, the game is only compatible with computers or devices with a keyboard.  
You can play it on your browser by clicking on the "start game" image.
